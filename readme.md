# OpenStack Community Metrics

The goal of this site is to make the contributions to the OpenStack community as transparent as possible. As a simple proof of concept, we thought it would be a good idea to provide community metrics for core projects, people, and companies.

## Queries

    - User metrics
      - changes per project in a given timeframe
      - amount of changes in a given timeframe (punchcard graph)
    - Project metrics
      - changes by user in a given timeframe
      - changes in a given timeframe
    - Company metrics
      - changes per project in a given timeframe
      - changes in a given timeframe
      - employee list in a given timeframe

## Todo

  * Implement static example chart for each query.
  * Implement api to retrieve needed data for said charts.
